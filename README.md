1 - created the CA4 codio workspace
2 - added the sample code to the website
3 - running the application on chrome with changing the port to 5000 did not work and displayed the 'Error: Cannot find module '/home/codio/workspace/index.js''
4 - in chrome it also gave an error '502 Bad Gateway' so trying to find a way to fix this
5 - fixed step 3 however it is now struggling to find another module 'Error: Cannot find module 'express''
6 - added complex navigation bar to both chat and index, for some reason the index one works but not the chat one.
7 - fixed navigation working in chat also
8 -
