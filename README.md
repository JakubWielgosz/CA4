1 - created the CA4 codio workspace
2 - added the sample code to the website
3 - running the application on chrome with changing the port to 5000 did not work and displayed the 'Error: Cannot find module '/home/codio/workspace/index.js''
4 - in chrome it also gave an error '502 Bad Gateway' so trying to find a way to fix this
5 - fixed step 3 however it is now struggling to find another module 'Error: Cannot find module 'express''
6 - added complex navigation bar to both chat and index, for some reason the index one works but not the chat one.
7 - fixed navigation working in chat also
8 - added the about page
9 - went with a light design of the website
10 - added a simple logo for the website
11 - cleaned up about page and added information to the index page
12 - added information to the about section
13 - could not figure out how to fix problem in step 3, multiple attempts could not get to running the server
14 - tidied everything up and submitted all to github

Home - decided to keep the information on the home page to a minimal and
       directing new users where to find everything they need, decided to use a
       copyright free image to help with the aesthetics of the home page

Chat - decided to go with a combination of light blue and shades of white as it looks
       very clean and fits the purpose of the website. Moved the message bar to the
       bottom of the page so that it is accessible and out of the way.

About - Used another copyright free image and displayed all my work experience, studies
        and future plans in a way so that it is nice and centred on the text section
        and so it looks way more appealing.
